For the 2019 season of Advent of Code, I decided to work on improving my coding skills with PowerShell. My work was doing a challenge for all members to try and get the most stars.
They wanted people to use PowerShell so that they could use the skills they learned at the job. 

Unfortauntely, I ran out of time to do more days but I did grealy enjoy the problems that I did do and I learned a lot of new skills that I still use on the job to this day.
